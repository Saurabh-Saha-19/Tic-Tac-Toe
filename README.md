# Tic Tac Toe Game App:

This is a tic tac toe ❌⭕❌ game app developed using HTML, CSS, and JS (with DOM Manipulation).

The functionalities are:
1.	Upon clicking a box ⬜, a random number is generated between 0 & 1, if it is 0 then the game starts with ‘⭕’, if it is 1 then ‘❌’.
2.	This works alternatively, suppose the game starts with ❌ then next time it automatically becomes ⭕, this is implemented with the help of turn variable.
3.	The event triggers a function which continuously checks for the winning pattern and if found the game is over and the winner is displayed.
4.	Once a winning pattern is found, the other boxes ⬜ gets disabled and the after 1sec the boxes ⬜ are set to display none and the winner 🏆 is displayed which is earlier hidden.
5.	The game also checks for the draw condition, if the winner is not found after 9th click then the game is declared as a draw!
